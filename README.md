An in depth project on AirBnb listings from 2021-2022. We aimed to create Machine Learning models to evaluate each listing's value in quality, pricing, and investigate how the price is distributed across New York City five boroughs.
The dataset we used was retrieved from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).
